# roshambo
After learning some new things in the Hack Reactor pre-course, I decided to re-attempt making
Roshambo in the short amount of time I had before the actual course started. I did a little
better, definitely not as much HTML as the first attempt, but I would definitely approach this
a little differently now since I've graduated Hack Reactor. Maybe I'll actually even finish it! :)
